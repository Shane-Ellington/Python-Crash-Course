    These are a collection of interesting problems I have worked on while reading Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes.
This book has been great so far, after each new concept there are prompts for aweseome little problems to work through on my own. This has been invaluable so far in providing me more confidence in my programming.
